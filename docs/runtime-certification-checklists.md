# Runtime Certification Checklists

Use these checklists for manual verification when CI cannot prove runtime-native discovery behavior.

## Claude Code

- Confirm `.claude/skills/legion/SKILL.md` exists in the expected scope.
- Confirm `.claude/commands/legion/` exists in the expected scope.

- Verify `.agents/skills/legion/SKILL.md` exists and maps legacy `/legion:*` aliases correctly.

## Cursor

- Confirm `.cursor/rules/legion.mdc` exists after local install.
- Restart or reload Cursor and verify the rule is visible in project rules.
- Ask Cursor in plain language to use Legion start and confirm it reads `.legion/commands/legion/start.md`.

- Restart Gemini CLI and run `/legion`.
- Verify Gemini reads the authoritative `.legion/commands/legion/start.md` file.
- Confirm nested namespace commands still resolve as compatibility aliases.
- Record whether this is an enterprise/pinned Gemini CLI environment; consumer Gemini CLI users should move to Antigravity.

## Antigravity CLI

- Confirm `.agents/plugins/legion/plugin.json` or `~/.gemini/config/plugins/legion/plugin.json` exists and is valid JSON.
- Verify skills, agents, and commands directories exist inside the plugin folder.

- Confirm `.kilo/skills/code-polish/SKILL.md` (or `~/.kilo/skills/code-polish/SKILL.md`) exists and its frontmatter `name:` field reads exactly `code-polish` (the spec-invalid `legion:code-polish` source name must be normalized at install time).
- Confirm at least three other skill folders exist under `.kilo/skills/` (e.g., `workflow-common`, `phase-decomposer`, `review-loop`).

## Kilo Code Plugin

- Confirm `.kilocode/workflows/legion.md`, `.kilo/commands/legion.md`, `~/.kilocode/workflows/legion.md`, or `~/.config/kilo/commands/legion.md` exists for the primary workflow surface.
- Confirm `.kilocode/workflows/legion-start.md`, `.kilocode/workflows/legion-board.md`, `~/.kilocode/workflows/legion-start.md`, or `~/.kilocode/workflows/legion-board.md` exists for the plugin workflow surface.
- Confirm `.kilo/commands/legion-start.md`, `.kilo/commands/legion-board.md`, `~/.config/kilo/commands/legion-start.md`, or `~/.config/kilo/commands/legion-board.md` exists for the CLI-backed workflow surface.
- Confirm `.kilocode/skills/board-of-directors/SKILL.md` or `~/.kilocode/skills/board-of-directors/SKILL.md` exists, and representative skill frontmatter names match their directory names.
- Confirm `.kilo/skills/board-of-directors/SKILL.md` or `~/.kilo/skills/board-of-directors/SKILL.md` exists, and representative skill frontmatter names match their directory names.

- Confirm `.kilocodemodes` or `~/.kilocode/globalStorage/kilo code.kilo-code/settings/custom_modes.yaml` contains `slug: legion`.
- Restart Kilo Code or reload the IDE window and verify the `Legion` custom mode, `/legion` workflow, and Legion skills are available.
- Run `/legion` and confirm the workflow routes through the single `Legion` mode and reads the authoritative command file in `.legion/commands/legion/`.
- Verify `/legion-start.md`, `/legion-start`, `/legion-board.md`, and `/legion-board` remain compatibility aliases when installed.

## Aider

- Confirm Legion does not offer an automated native install for Aider.
- If you choose the manual path, verify `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, or `.aider.conf.yml` contains the intended Legion guidance.
- Use `/ask` for read-only Legion advisory sessions.
- Use `/architect` and `/code` manually after loading the relevant Legion workflow file by hand.

## Scope and Operator

This checklist is for human operators only. Each item uses verbs like "verify", "confirm", and "trigger" without a machine-checkable pass predicate. Programmatic validation of Legion adapter installations lives in a separate harness (see `/legion:validate` and adapter conformance tests). Do not dispatch an agent to "run the checklist" — use `/legion:validate` instead.

## Completion Gate (for human operators)

The certification run is complete when ALL of the following hold for the CLI under test:
1. The primary Legion entry point for that runtime appears in the host's skill, command, prompt, agent, or mode listing.
2. Invoking a representative command through the primary entry point (for example, `/legion start`, `/project:legion start`, `/prompts:legion start`, `@legion start`, or Legion mode with `start`) loads the installed file documented for that runtime in `adapters/{cli}.md`.
3. A plain-language prompt containing the phrase "use Legion start" causes the host to load the same installed file as the primary entry path.
4. No command prints an error or "not found" message for any Legion command on the canonical list
5. The operator has recorded PASS/FAIL per item for the CLI under test; partial runs are marked `incomplete` and are NOT certifications

If ANY condition is unmet, the CLI is NOT certified — file the failing item(s) as an issue and re-run after fix.
