/**
 * Ship readiness derived from ADR-006 risk gates.
 *
 * `legion ship` previously asked one question: does an accepted review row
 * exist? That is a row-existence check, not a readiness gate — it says nothing
 * about which gates the change's risk tier actually demands. This module
 * derives the required gate set from `DEFAULT_RISK_POLICY` and reports each
 * gate's real status.
 *
 * Three statuses, deliberately distinct:
 *  - `satisfied`   — evidence exists and is positive.
 *  - `unsatisfied` — evidence exists and is negative. Blocks.
 *  - `unevaluable` — Legion does not yet produce evidence of this kind at all.
 *
 * `unevaluable` is not a quiet pass. It is counted and named in the ship
 * payload so the gap is visible on every run. It is reported rather than
 * blocking because the gap is a missing product capability, not a property of
 * the change under review — blocking on it would make ship permanently red
 * while telling the operator nothing they could act on.
